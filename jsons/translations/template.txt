Good day it is, Julio, you, unlike others, did great things for Argentina, a prideful nation with good prowess. Argentina came from the provinces of the De La Plata river, who broke free from Spain into their own path. Conquering the Mapuches, they expanded their territory, and after that, their economy grew more and more, until becoming one of the best in Latin America. Altough not being very successful in war, Argentina today is stable and periodically good. = 
President, your people call you to bring good to the country. Will you make a civilization that can stand the pass of time? = 

I need to do this, for the sake of progress. You were never my friend. =

Since the start we had a ton of great political division, which brought many problems and conflicts, but despite all the troubles, Colombia ought to help others, no matter what. The conflicts didn't ceased until early 21st century, where the sun finally rises over Colombia to achieve greatness. =

Mr. President, welcome. Has you know, you lead the great, ancient, cultural nation of the Peru. The nations dates back to the mighty Incas, after being colonised. The colony was one of the major ones for the spanish - and that wasn't for no reason -. The ungrateful spaniards wasted all the money, increased taxes, and combined with many other things, Peru rebeled. After a failed attempt, the joint effort of Simon Bolivar, and most importantly, San Martin, gave the freedom to the peruvians, which continued to exploit their mineral richies, and culture abundance. =

The so dreamed independece would not come until the Battle of Carabobo, glory to the brave people, Venezuela has been born in Carabobo!, and the venezuelan richness would have a rise mid the 20 century, thanks to their resources. =
